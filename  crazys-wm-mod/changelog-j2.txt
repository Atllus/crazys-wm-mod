###  Changes before 12/27/2015
I kindof dropped out of working on the game because work was draining me too much mentally and physically.
As a result I did not work on the game at all for 2 months but other people did.
Much of what they have done I have not really gone through yet so I can't really comment on it for now.
Several new image types and a few new jobs have been added as well as a lot of new texts for jobs.


###  Changes 12/27/2015 - I'm back :)
Added color configuration to text items in interface xmls
* Add Red, Green and Blue tags to the <Text> block with numbers 0-255 to add hex colors
** <Text Name="Label1" Text="Brothel Name" XPos="32" YPos="32" Width="128" Height="32" FontSize="16" Red="250" Green="0" Blue="0" />
Added popup_message.xml to the interface so it can be customized.
Added more debug lines to torture code to narrow down the cause of crashes.
